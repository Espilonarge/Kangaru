"Austrus. Home world of the Kangaru."

"Born beneath the warmth of a bright sun. Wanderers of a great world... "

"Guided by the southern stars that chart the night sky. They arise to any challenge that may lie ahead."

"... but something has stirred in the shadows... something thought only as myth... something wished long forgotten..."
"The Cult of the Weavers.. has returned."

"Outmatched and outnumbered, they are forced in to exodus from Austrus."
"They now must gather their strength, forge new alliances and restore Austrus to its once true color."
